# IPL Points Table Simulator

A web application that displays the current IPL points table and allows users to simulate the outcomes of remaining matches to see how the final standings might change. Predict, simulate, and play with IPL results! Adjust match outcomes and instantly see how the points table changes.

**Live Demo:** [https://saieshshirodkar.github.io/ipl-points-table-sim/](https://saieshshirodkar.github.io/ipl-points-table-sim/)

## Features

*   **View Current Standings:** Displays the IPL points table based on the latest available data (as of the last update indicated on the page).
*   **Simulate Remaining Matches:** Presents cards for each remaining match in the league stage.
*   **Select Match Outcomes:**
    *   Click on a team's button to mark them as the winner of that match.
    *   Use the dropdown menu (three dots icon) on a match card to select "No Result" (awards 1 point to each team).
*   **Instant Updates:** The points table dynamically updates with every simulated match result, recalculating points, wins, losses, N/R, and estimated Net Run Rate (NRR).
*   **NRR Simulation:** Provides an estimated NRR based on initial data and simulated wins/losses. *Note: Score input fields are present but currently do not drive the NRR calculation.*
*   **Reset Simulation:** A reset button clears all simulated results, reverting the table to its initial state.
*   **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes for usability on desktop and mobile devices.
